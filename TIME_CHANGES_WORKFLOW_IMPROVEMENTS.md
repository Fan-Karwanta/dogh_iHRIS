# Time Changes Page - Workflow Improvements

## Problems Fixed

### âœ… 1. Month Filter Resets to Current Month
**Problem**: When clicking edit, the page would refresh and reset to October (current month), even if you were viewing September data.

**Solution**: 
- Month selection now persists in session storage
- URL parameter tracks selected month
- When you select September, it stays on September even after edits
- No more having to re-select the month filter repeatedly

### âœ… 2. Slow Multi-Row Editing Workflow
**Problem**: Editing multiple rows was time-consuming and inefficient.

**Solution**: Added **Quick Edit Mode** with multiple time-saving features:

## New Features

### ðŸš€ Quick Apply Times Panel
A new panel at the top of the page with:
- **Pre-set time fields**: Set your desired times once (AM In, AM Out, PM In, PM Out)
- **Apply to multiple rows**: Select checkboxes and click "Apply to Selected Rows"
- **One-click updates**: All selected rows get the same times instantly
- **Perfect for**: Correcting multiple days with same schedule

**Example Use Case**:
- Employee forgot to clock in for entire week
- Set times: 7:30 AM, 12:00 PM, 1:00 PM, 5:00 PM
- Select all 5 days (Monday-Friday)
- Click "Apply to Selected Rows"
- Done in 10 seconds instead of 5 minutes!

## Technical Implementation

### Month Persistence

$this->session->set_userdata('timechanges_selected_month_' . $bio_id, $selected_month);

// JavaScript updates URL to maintain state
window.history.pushState({path: newUrl}, '', newUrl);
```

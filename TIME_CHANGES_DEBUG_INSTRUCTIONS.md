# Time Changes - Debug Mode Instructions

## What I Added

### 1. Visual Debug Panel
At the top of the page, you'll now see a **green status panel** showing:
- ✅ **Status**: Current operation (Ready, Loading, etc.)
- **Current Month**: The month that's currently selected
- **Last Action**: What happened last and when

### 2. Console Logging
Every action is logged to browser console with `[TIME CHANGES]` prefix

### 3. Month Lock Warning
A yellow warning box that shows the current locked month

### 4. Page Navigation Warning
If you try to leave the page, you'll get a warning (this helps catch unwanted navigation)

## How to Test

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
1. Press **F12** on your keyboard
2. Click the **Console** tab
3. Keep it open while testing

### Step 2: Clear Everything
In the console, type:
```javascript
localStorage.clear()
```
Press Enter, then refresh the page (**Ctrl+F5**)

### Step 3: Select September
1. In the month filter, select **September 2025** (or 2025-09)
2. Watch the console - you should see:
   ```
   [TIME CHANGES] Month LOCKED to: 2025-09
   ```
3. Watch the status panel - should show "Ready - Month Locked"

### Step 4: Click Edit Button
1. Click any **Edit** button in the table
2. **Watch carefully**:
   - Console should show: `[TIME CHANGES] Edit button clicked - NO NAVIGATION SHOULD OCCUR`
   - Status panel should update to "Loading record..."
   - Modal should open
   - **NO PAGE REFRESH SHOULD HAPPEN**

### Step 5: Check Month
After modal opens:
- Look at status panel - "Current Month" should still show **2025-09**
- Look at month filter - should still show **September**
- Console should show: `[TIME CHANGES] Opening modal - Month still: 2025-09`

## What to Report

### If Page Refreshes:
1. **BEFORE clicking Edit**, take a screenshot of:
   - The page
   - The console (F12)
   - The month filter showing September

2. **Click Edit button**

3. **If page refreshes**, immediately:
   - Take screenshot of console
   - Look for any error messages in RED
   - Note what the month changed to

4. Send me:
   - Both screenshots
   - What month it changed to
   - Any error messages

### If Edit Button Doesn't Work:
1. Open console (F12)
2. Click Edit button
3. Look for errors in console (red text)
4. Screenshot the errors
5. Send to me

### If Modal Opens But Month Changes:
1. This means modal is working!
2. But something is changing the month
3. Check console for: `[TIME CHANGES] Opening modal - Month still: XXXXX`
4. Tell me what XXXXX shows

## Expected Console Output

When everything works correctly, you should see:

```
[TIME CHANGES] Month LOCKED to: 2025-09
[TIME CHANGES] Ready - Month Locked | Month: 2025-09
[TIME CHANGES] Edit button clicked - NO NAVIGATION SHOULD OCCUR
[TIME CHANGES] Loading record... | Month: 2025-09
[TIME CHANGES] Record loaded successfully
[TIME CHANGES] Opening modal - Month still: 2025-09
[TIME CHANGES] Modal opened | Month: 2025-09
```

**Key Point**: Month should ALWAYS be `2025-09` (or whatever you selected)

## Common Issues

### Issue: "$ is not defined"
**Solution**: jQuery not loaded. Refresh page.

### Issue: "SITE_URL is not defined"
**Solution**: Check footer.php has `var SITE_URL = ...`

### Issue: Edit button does nothing
**Solution**: 
1. Check console for errors
2. Verify button has class `edit-bio-btn`
3. Check if event is attached: Type in console:
   ```javascript
   $._data(document, 'events')
   ```

### Issue: Page still refreshes
**Possible causes**:
1. Another script is interfering
2. Browser extension blocking AJAX
3. Server redirecting

**Debug**:
1. Try in incognito/private mode
2. Disable all browser extensions
3. Check Network tab for redirects

## Success Criteria

✅ Console shows all `[TIME CHANGES]` messages
✅ Status panel updates correctly
✅ Month stays on September
✅ Modal opens without page refresh
✅ No errors in console
✅ Edit and save works
✅ Table reloads without losing month

## If Still Not Working

If after following ALL these steps, it still doesn't work:

1. **Export console log**:
   - Right-click in console
   - "Save as..."
   - Send me the file

2. **Record screen**:
   - Use Windows Game Bar (Win+G)
   - Record clicking the Edit button
   - Show the console during recording

3. **Check PHP errors**:
   - Look in `application/logs/` folder
   - Send any recent error logs

4. **Verify files**:
   - Make sure `timeChanges.js` was saved
   - Make sure `TimeChanges.php` was saved
   - Clear browser cache again

## Quick Test Command

Paste this in console to test if everything is loaded:

```javascript
console.log('jQuery:', typeof $ !== 'undefined' ? 'OK' : 'MISSING');
console.log('SITE_URL:', typeof SITE_URL !== 'undefined' ? SITE_URL : 'MISSING');
console.log('Table:', typeof table !== 'undefined' ? 'OK' : 'NOT LOADED');
console.log('Month:', $('#month').val());
console.log('Edit buttons:', $('.edit-bio-btn').length);
```

Expected output:
```
jQuery: OK
SITE_URL: http://localhost/dogh_dtr/
Table: OK
Month: 2025-09
Edit buttons: 30 (or however many rows you have)
```

## Summary

The page now has:
- ✅ Visual status panel
- ✅ Console logging for every action
- ✅ Month lock indicator
- ✅ Page navigation warning
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

**This will help us identify EXACTLY where the problem is!**
